        'A cultural celebration in Belu Regency, East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) called the Fulan Fehan Festival was held in the valley at the foot of Mount Lakaan. The valley is a beautiful and cool open earth day in Belu Regency, a border area between the Republic of Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste. Atambua, the capital city of Belu, is located about 26 kilometers from the harsh but beautiful Fulan Fehan Valley.In 2018, the Fulan Fehan Festival raises a treasure of art originating from the myth of human origins in the region, namely "Likurai Dance". In the mythology of the Belu people, it is stated that in ancient times, the world at that time was still narrow, there was conflict between humans and the monkey nation. Humans had to fight with the monkey nation in order to survive. Of course, the human managed to win the war. The king then ordered a ceremony to be held. welcoming the war heroes who have defeated the monkey nation. On that order, "ko lo kolo, bui muk” as a dance instrument. The women use kolo kolo bui muk as a dance property. Performed in front of the traditional house, this victory dance is then called Likurai. In accordance with the times, there are no more wars, so the Likurai dance is performed in official customary events, or for example welcoming guests at Belu. In 2016, the Ministry of Education and Culture established the Likurai dance as Indonesia\'s intangible cultural heritage. In the people of the Belu region and its surroundings, this dance is not only a vehicle for welcoming those who have won the battle, but also a vehicle for embodiment, glorification and dissemination of expressions of the values of cooperation, mutual cooperation, hospitality, mutual respect and tolerance.\nBefore the grand display in the Fulan Fehan Valley, the Foho Rai Festival was held, in five traditional village locations. The design of the Foho Rai Festival is a way to present the supporting ecosystem for the Likurai Dance. Likurai dance as a bud unit',

        "Kelimutu (pronounced [kəliˈmutu]) is a volcano, close to the small town of Moni in central Flores island in Indonesia. It is around 50 km (31 mi) to the east of Ende, Indonesia, the capital of Ende regency in East Nusa Tenggara province. It has three volcanic crater lakes that differ in color. The science of the Kelimutu lakes is relatively well-known, and the changes in color and temperature are concluded to be related to volcanic activity and the resulting fluid flux at vents at the bottom of the lakes. The Lake colors periodically change due to adjustments in the oxidation-reduction status of the fluid of each lake, and also considering the abundance of different major elements, such as iron and manganese. Oxidation-reduction status depends on the balance of volcanic gas input and rainfall rate, and is thought to be mediated by the groundwater system in the volcano itself. The colors in the lakes change independently from each other, as each has its own unique connectivity to the underlying volcano's activity. Between January and November 2016, the colors of the craters changed six times. Although it is widely believed that the changes are unpredictable, it is more accurate to say that the lack of any regular monitoring of the volcanic system precludes scientists from having the data necessary to drive widely available predictive models.",

    title: "Wayang",
    description: """
Wayang (derived from Javanese: ꦮꦪꦁ, translit. wayang, lit. 'shadow') is a traditional Indonesian performing art that originated and developed rapidly on the islands of Java and Bali.

On November 7, 2003, UNESCO, the institution in charge of culture of the United Nations, established wayang as the most famous shadow puppet show from Indonesia, an invaluable World Heritage Masterpiece in the Art of Speech (English: Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity).[1] [2][3]

Until now, the earliest record that can be obtained about wayang performances comes from the Balitung Inscription in the 10th Century. In 903 AD, an inscription called the Balitung Inscription (Mantyasih) was created by King Balitung of the Sanjaya Dynasty, from the Ancient Medang Kingdom. They declared Si Galigi Mawayang for Hyang Macarita Bimma Ya Kumara, which means 'Galigi puts on a puppet show for the gods by taking the story of Bima Kumara'.[4] It seems that certain features of the traditional puppet theater have survived since then. Galigi was a traveling artist who was asked to perform for a special royal event. At that event he presented a story about the hero Bima from the Mahabharata.

Mpu Kanwa, the court poet of Airlangga from the Kahuripan Kingdom, wrote in 1035 AD in his kakawin Arjunawiwaha: santoṣâhĕlĕtan kĕlir sira sakêng sang hyang Jagatkāraṇa, which means, "He is steadfast and only a puppet screen is far from the 'Mover of the World'." Kelir is the Javanese word for wayang screen, a verse that eloquently compares real life to a wayang performance in which the almighty Jagatkāraṇa (world mover) as supreme dalang (wayang teacher) is but a thin screen of humans. This mention of wayang as wayang kulit indicates that wayang performances were already known at Airlangga's court and that wayang traditions were well established in Java, perhaps earlier. An inscription from this period also mentions some work as awayang and aringgit.[5]

When Hinduism entered Indonesia and adapted the existing culture, this performing arts became an effective medium for spreading Hinduism. Wayang shows use stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

The Wali Songo in Java have divided the wayang into three. Wayang kulit in the east, wayang wong in Central Java and wayang golek in West Java. It is Raden Patah and Sunan Kali Jaga who have made great contributions. Look for wayang in West Java, golek ono in Jawi language, until you find the wong whose contents are in the middle, don't just find the skin in the East in wetan wiwitan. Looking for that identity in the West or Kulon or kula that is in the human heart. The intentions of the Wali are too noble and high in philosophy. Wayang is pure from the original Java, pakeliran means the pair between the shadows and the original object. Like two shahada sentences. As for God masyrik wal maghrib, it must first be translated into Javanese, which means wetan kawitan and kulon or kula or I who is inside. Seek the god who is first born and who is in the human heart. (sik)

Likewise, when Islam entered, when performances featuring "God" or "gods" in human form were prohibited, wayang puppets made of cowhide appeared, in which only their shadows were seen during the performance. This wayang is what we now know as wayang kulit. To spread Islam, Sadat puppets were also developed which introduced Islamic values.

When the Catholic missionary, Brother Timotheus L. Wignyosubroto, FIC, in 1960, was on his mission to spread Catholicism, he developed Wayang Wahyu, whose source of stories comes from the Bible.
